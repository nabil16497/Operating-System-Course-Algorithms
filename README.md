All the codes are done in C++. There are 5 scheduling algorithms. First Come First Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF/ non-preemptive SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF/ preemptive SJF), Round Robin (RR) and Priority Scheduling. These is also another algorithm of deadlock chapter. Banker's Algorithm
